## Weather Tracker
## Description
The goal of this project was to use HTML/CSS/Javascript to create a dynamic weather app. This app leverages openweathermap API. Using fetch requests, I am able to access the data provided by openweather map. I then use JS to dynamically create elements that are populated with the data provided by the fetch request.

During this project I learned and applied a lot of Javascript. This included setting global and local variables, arrays, functions, if and if/else statements. Additionally I learned how to traverse the dom and use Javascript associated functions such as getElementById, querySelector, appendChild. The biggest thing I learned was using fetch request and the .then method in order to manipulated data and dynamically create a webpage, based on that data.

## Usage
To use, enter a city name in the search box, and click the search button. The webpage will then do a fetch request and populate with data based on the search.
